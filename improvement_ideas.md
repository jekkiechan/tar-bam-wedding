1. Establish a palette from the illustration
Use its warm tones as your core theme so everything feels cohesive: e.g., suit brown (≈ #8A6A52), hair brown (≈ #6B4E3B), paper-cream (≈ #F6F1EA). Background: paper-cream; text: deep brown; accents (buttons/rules): mid-brown. This alone will make the page feel designed rather than default.


2. Typography that signals “wedding”
Pair an elegant serif for display (e.g., Cormorant Garamond, Playfair Display, or Fraunces) with a clean sans for body (Inter, Source Sans, or Lato).
– H1: couple names (or your monogram) large and graceful.
– Subhead: the date (e.g., “Saturday • 20 December 2025”) in small caps or thin caps.
– Body: 18–20px for comfortable reading. Tighten line-height for headings, loosen for body.


3. Real hero header (replace “You are invited”)
Top section: names + date as the focal point, then a soft divider, then the illustration. This creates immediate identity and solves the missing date.


4. Convert the bullet list into a timeline
Swap the asterisks for a refined vertical timeline with thin hairline dividers and small iconography (door/plate/music/heart). Keep it airy with generous spacing; label each time in a consistent typographic style.


5. Turn the RSVP link into a primary button
Large, rounded button, mid-brown fill on cream background with a gentle hover (slight lift/shadow or 3% color shift). Repeat the button at both the hero and the footer to reduce scrolling friction.


6. Add a subtle “paper” surface and borders
A faint handmade-paper texture (2–4% opacity) plus an inset 1px border (very light brown) around the main content column gives a printed-invitation vibe without hurting readability.


7. Set a comfortable content width & spacing scale
Constrain to ~720–840px max-width; add consistent vertical rhythm (e.g., 8px spacing scale: 8/16/24/32/48). This will fix any “floating” feeling and unify the sections.


8. Gentle motion, not gimmicks
Fade-in the hero and illustration on load; slide-up for each timeline item on scroll (very short duration, low easing). Keep it subtle so it feels premium.


9. Venue section polish
Use a small section title (“Venue”), then the hotel name in serif, address below in sans, and a “View in Google Maps” text link styled to match the palette. Consider a tiny map pin icon in your accent color.


10. Finishing touches (tiny but high-impact)
– Add a favicon/OG image (use the illustration on a cream background).
– Ensure the illustration sits on the same cream tone (no harsh white edges).
– Add alt text to the illustration for accessibility (“Illustration of Tar and Bam”).
– If you have a monogram/logo, place it in the header as a soft watermark or small crest.
